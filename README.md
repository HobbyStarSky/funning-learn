This is a algorithm about B Spline. In this project, including a illustration file and several Matlab codes. 
The clear description as follow:
1) The illustration file describes the theroy which tells us the basic concept of B Spline and how to build a n-th B Spline.
2) The code "buildQuadraticBSpline.m" is a example which build a segment 2-th B Spline. 
   The code "buildCubicBSpline.m" is a example which build a segment 3-th B Spline.
   The code "test.m" is a example which tell us how to use above-mentioned two codes build continuous B Spline.
